## Code of Conduct

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Check the [FAQ](docs/faq.md)** for a list of common questions and issues.
- **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/audiojak/tinychunker/issues)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). Create an issue and provide the following information by filling in the provided template:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the steps to reproduce the issue** as clearly as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps.
- **Describe the behavior you observed** after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see** instead and why.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. 

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

- **Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/audiojak/tinychunker/issues)** for similar suggestions.
- **Check if the enhancement is already planned** or in progress.

#### How Do I Submit An Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are also tracked as GitHub issues. Provide the following information:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the suggestion.
- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to the project.

### Your First Code Contribution

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain project quality.
- Fix problems that are important to users.
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible library.
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions.

#### Before Submitting A Pull Request

- **Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed** before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- **Update the documentation** with details of changes to the interface, including new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
- **Increase the version numbers** in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
- **You may merge the Pull Request** once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Style Guides

### Code Style

- Follow the style guides for the project.
- Use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure consistent code style.
- Write meaningful comments in your code where necessary.

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
